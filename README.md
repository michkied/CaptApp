# CaptApp
CaptApp is a desktop application that captures sound from an audio output, automatically transcribes it using Google Speech API, and displays the resulting 
caption as a system overlay. The app's main purpose is to enable a better digital experience for people with hearing difficulties, as it works regardless of
the browser, movie/audio player, communicators and other programs in use.

### Early phase
Keep in mind that CaptApp is still in development. As of now:
- The overlay cannot be dragged nor resized.
- Transcriptions may sometimes be incomplete.
